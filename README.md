# UniPython Practice 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering fundamental Python concepts and data structures.

## 📚 Contents

This repository includes hands-on practice with the following Python topics:

### 📓 Jupyter Notebooks

| Notebook | Description | Topics Covered |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| [`basics.ipynb`](./basics.ipynb) | Python fundamentals and core concepts | Variables, data types, operators, control flow |
| [`list.ipynb`](./list.ipynb) | Working with Python lists | List operations, methods, comprehensions |
| [`set.ipynb`](./set.ipynb) | Set data structure operations | Set creation, operations, methods |
| [`tuples.ipynb`](./tuples.ipynb) | Tuple data structure practice | Tuple operations, immutability, use cases |
| [`second.ipynb`](./second.ipynb) | Additional Python practice | Extended exercises and examples |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Basic understanding of Python syntax

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saadkhan2003/UniPythonPractice.git
cd UniPythonPractice
```

2. Install Jupyter if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open any `.ipynb` file to start exploring!

## 📖 Learning Path

I recommend following this order for optimal learning:

1. **Start with** `basics.ipynb` - Foundation concepts
2. **Continue with** `list.ipynb` - Understanding lists
3. **Explore** `tuples.ipynb` - Immutable sequences
4. **Practice with** `set.ipynb` - Unique collections
5. **Extend learning** with `second.ipynb` - Additional exercises

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through these notebooks, you'll gain proficiency in:

- ✅ Python syntax and basic programming concepts
- ✅ Data structure manipulation (lists, tuples, sets)
- ✅ Control flow and conditional statements
- ✅ Function definitions and usage
- ✅ Problem-solving with Python
- ✅ Interactive coding with Jupyter notebooks

## 📝 Notes

- Each notebook contains explanations, code examples, and practice exercises
- Code cells can be executed individually for hands-on learning
- Feel free to modify and experiment with the code
- All notebooks are designed for educational purposes
